        <p>He is the figure — literary, cultural, and imaginative — whose essays and provocations have formed the scaffold for a public project now called Fletcherism. Ryan is less an authority and more a provoker of attention: a writer who composes invitations to look more carefully and act more kindly.</p>

        <p class="muted">Fletcherism treats authorship as collaborative; the founder's texts are seeds, not law. Every reader is invited to cultivate those seeds in their own local soil.</p>

        <div class="manifesto">
          <h4>Introduction — Why Fletcherism?</h4>
          <p>You arrive with a thousand things already in your head: obligations, a public face, habits of attention shaped by other people’s priorities. Fletcherism begins by asking one simple question: what do you habitually not see? This isn't an accusation. It is an invitation to a deliberate kind of noticing that becomes practice, then habit, and then culture.</p>

          <p>The movement proposes three interlocking commitments. The first is curiosity — not as mere consumption of novelty but as disciplined, methodical attention. The second is relationality — a recognition that insight is rarely solitary and is always formed in networks of conversation, labor, and love. The third is craft — the idea that thought itself can be honed, practiced, and shaped like any other skill.</p>

          <h4>Core Declaration</h4>
          <p>We declare that stories are tools and that tools can be retooled. We hold that spectacle should never entirely displace small acts of stewardship. We believe that a practice of attention is a form of care — for ourselves, for others, and for the world we share.</p>

          <h4>Method</h4>
          <p>Method matters. Fletcherism is not a set of slogans; it is a set of techniques for reshaping attention and action. Techniques include: the reading circle, the attention diary, the neighborhood repair day, the micro-gesture of public kindness, and the practice of reclassification (e.g., playful thought experiments that challenge categories).</p>

          <h4>On Truth and Play</h4>
          <p>We refuse the binary that pits rigorous truth-seeking against imaginative play. Fletcherism insists that play is itself a method of discovery. A playful reclassification may suggest a new hypothesis; a careful experiment may yield a beautiful metaphor. Both are valuable. Both belong.</p>

          <h4>Public Ethics</h4>
          <p>Participation in Fletcherism implies an ethical compact: to act without harm, to seek consent, to be transparent about fiction and speculation, and to center ecological responsibilities. The practices of the movement are explicitly noncoercive and volunteer-based; they are organized to increase care rather than to exert control.</p>

          <h4>Language and Rhetoric</h4>
          <p>Fletcherism cultivates a rhetoric of precision and porousness: precise enough to be helpful, porous enough to invite correction. We prefer metaphors that illuminate rather than obscure. When we use striking claims — such as playful reclassifications or symbolic cosmologies — we label them as tools for thought, not as final statements.</p>

          <h4>The Arc of Participation</h4>
          <p>You may enter Fletcherism as a reader, a participant, or a contributor. The arc tends to follow three stages: (1) attentive reading and small experiments; (2) participation in community practices and local projects; (3) contribution to the corpus through essays, art, or organizing. All three are valid and honored paths.</p>

          <h4>Long View</h4>
          <p>We practice patience. The work is not to win immediate conversions but to cultivate durable habits. Over years, small acts produce different kinds of culture: more mutual aid, more reciprocal care, and a richer public language for noticing what matters.</p>

          <h4>Invitation</h4>
          <p>If you find this plausible — whether as method, metaphor, or moral practice — then Fletcherism is a resource for you. Take what helps. Leave what does not. But above all: notice.</p>

          <div class="quote" aria-hidden="false">
            <p>“Noticing is the first revolution: a quiet insurgency against what is taken for granted.”</p>
          </div>

          <h4>Expanded Essays (Selected)</h4>
          <p><strong>On the Ecology of Attention.</strong> Attention is not simply a human resource; it is an ecological phenomenon. What we attend to proliferates: caring attention nurtures life and meaning; neglect allows entropy to expand. Fletcherist practice treats attention as a renewable ethic.</p>

          <p><strong>On Playful Reclassification.</strong> Sometimes, when a mind gets stuck, a simple mental swap — treat this object as that category — loosens the knot. Playful reclassification operates like a cognitive locksmith: it opens new ways of seeing problems and possible solutions.</p>

          <p><strong>On Conversation as Architecture.</strong> Discursive spaces — reading circles, quiet cafés, public benches — shape thought. Fletcherism encourages deliberate design of conversational spaces that allow slower thinking and mutual listening.</p>

          <h4>Practical Programs (a partial list)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Attention Diary:</strong> a daily three-line practice: one observation, one question, one small action.</li>
            <li><strong>Neighborhood Repair:</strong> quarterly volunteer days to repair public benches, plant greenery, or start a seed library.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading Circles:</strong> small groups that read one long essay a month and produce a public reflection.</li>
            <li><strong>Micro-Exchange:</strong> time-banking and skill-share formats that reinforce local reciprocity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>How to Use This Site</h4>
          <p>Begin with the Teachings page for a compact statement of practice. Visit The Book to read longer essays and curated selections. Use Contact to find or start a local chapter. This site is intentionally modular: take the pages in any order that helps you form practice.</p>

          <h4>Closing</h4>
          <p>We do not promise answers that fix the world; we promise practices that change how you look at it. Fletcherism is less an edict than a set of rehearsals. Over time, rehearsal becomes habit; habit becomes culture; culture becomes the shared environment for kinder, more curious lives.</p>

      <h3 id="practice">Practices & Rituals — How to Make It Work</h3>
      <p>Practices are not ornaments. They are deliberate habits designed to change the shape of attention over weeks and years. Below are extended practices that you can adopt individually or with a group. They are described with concrete steps so you can start immediately.</p>

      <h4>Attention Diary — A Daily Practice</h4>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2–7 minutes each morning or evening.</p>
      <p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open a small notebook or a notes app.</li>
        <li>Write one sentence describing something you noticed that others would likely miss.</li>
        <li>Write one question about that observation — sincere and answerable or not.</li>
        <li>Write one tiny experiment you might try today to explore the question (e.g., ask a neighbor, test light at different times of day, plant a seed).</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> build a habit of noticing small differences and converting them into gentle experiments. Over months this practice produces a private archive and a new habit of refined attention.</p>

      <h4>Reading Circle — A Group Practice</h4>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> one monthly meeting of 60–90 minutes.</p>
      <p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose one long essay or chapter (30–60 minutes of reading).</li>
        <li>Designate a facilitator (rotating role).</li>
        <li>Begin with three minutes of silent reflection on the assigned text.</li>
        <li>Take turns: each member reads a short passage aloud and shares one practical takeaway.</li>
        <li>End by deciding on one communal action to try before the next meeting (planting, sharing a public notice, performing a micro-repair).</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> convert private reading into public practice and mutual accountability.</p>

      <h4>Neighborhood Repair — A Seasonal Practice</h4>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2–6 hours once per quarter.</p>
      <p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify an accessible project (bench repair, litter pick, seed distribution).</li>
        <li>Coordinate with local homeowners or public works when necessary.</li>
        <li>Document the event with a short note or photo to share with the local reading circle.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> produce visible, local acts of care that connect thought to material reality.</p>

      <h4>Playful Reclassification Exercises</h4>
      <p>Practice exercises that reassign categories: call one household object by another category for 24 hours, or redesign a menu item by shifting its cultural label. The aim is cognitive flexibility and creative empathy.</p>

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section class="card" style="margin-top:22px;" aria-labelledby="faq">
      <h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

      <h4>Is Fletcherism a religion?</h4>
      <p>No. Fletcherism is a cultural-philosophical project. It offers practices and rhetorical frameworks for attention and care, not doctrine or salvation.</p>

      <h4>Do I need to agree with the founder to participate?</h4>
      <p>No. The founder's texts are seeds. You are welcome to disagree, adapt, or transform. The community honors pluralism and critical dialogue.</p>

      <h4>What commitments are required?</h4>
      <p>None. Participation is voluntary. Local chapters may ask for small volunteer contributions or skill-sharing time to support events and stewardship efforts.</p>

      <h4>How can I start a chapter?</h4>
      <p>Start by organizing one reading circle and one neighborhood practice. Use the Contact page to register your chapter and ask for support materials.</p>
